{"name":"New Fields for Morphology","tagline":"Website for the New Fields for Morphology Workshop","body":"New Fields for Morphology aims to bring together linguists working on the morphology of less widely studied languages who are also interested in morphological theory.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of the conference is to engage morphological theory with exciting new empirical data, especially from the Australia + Pacific region. We hope to foster a community of morphologists concerned with both empirical and theoretical issues in Australia and abroad. Contributions are ideally based on first-hand data of individual languages or adopt a broadly comparative perspective.\r\n\r\nAll theoretical frameworks are equally welcome including papers which do not fit in with any particular framework. Papers that adopt a diachronic or comparative perspective are also welcomed to the extent it serves to engage theoretical concerns.\r\n \r\n**Organisers:**\r\n\r\nMatthew J.
